# Topic-Modelling-using-NLP
Showcasing data handling through NLP and models which come under the same domain with help of gensim and pyLDAvis visualization modules

## Description

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique thatâ€™s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. It includes classification hierarchy, Topic modelling methods, different evolution models of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Latent semantic analysis (LSA). Data preprocessing ws done using NLP techniques while incorporating pyLDAvis and gensim for visualization as well and above models for comparative study.

## Technology Stack

Languages : Python<br>
Models : Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
Modules : pandas, numpy, nltk, pyLDAvis, gensim

## Data

The usual data pre-processing steps like removing stop words, punctuations then creating dictionary and listing occurences with frequency of each words in orde to classify in groups.

## Results

Coherence score was used to distinguish or check the similarity between topics for 2 models used. Overall 10 topics were identified based on the occurrences.<br>
